<p><body>As Singapore is well connected by MRT, it is possible to experience, at your convenience, a selection of the very best of our local food that are but a short walk from the MRT stations. This page welcomes you to the vicinity of Commonwealth MRT Station...</p>

<p title="Commonwealth MRT Station"><img src="cmwmrt2.jpg" alt="Commonwealth MRT Station" width="500" height="333"></p>
<p>Commonwealth MRT Station is within the vicinity of Tanglin Halt and Commonwealth Crescent. It is one of the oldest satellite town and has many established local eateries, where these "old" establishments still retain their old authentic ways of cooking.</p>

<p>For starter, here are three stalls that has a very long heritage.</p>


<p><ul>
<li><a href="#C1">Chef Hainanese Western Food</a></li>
<li><a href="#C2">Hong Kee Porridge</a></li>
<li><a href="#C3">Tanglin Halt Roti Prata</a></li>

<p title="Chef Hainanese Western Food">



<p title="Chef Hainanese Western Food"><body>Nestled in the Tanglin Halt Food Centre, Chef Hainanese Western Food 海南西餐 is one of the most visited stalls to dabao Hainanese style Western food for dinner, and for a very good reason. While the stall only opens at 7pm or so, you may see a line forming here from 6:30pm or even earlier.</p>

<p title="Chef Hainanese Western Food">You will find traditional Hainanese style food with authentic Western flavours that are wholesome and filling.</P>

<p title="Chef Set 1"><img src="cmwchef2.jpg" alt="Chef Set 1" width="500" height="333"></p>
<p title="Chef Hainanese Western Food">The price is quite affordable, but due to the limited working hours and only dinner time servings, customers are often welcomed by snaking long queues (and yes, please maintain your social distance).</p>

<p title="Chef Hainanese Western Food">If you are really hungry and love a big portion, the four Chef Sets (priced at $10 each) with various combinations of half spring chicken, grilled chicken, grill fish, pork chop and sausage would satisfy that.</p>

<p title="Chef Set 2"><img src="cmwchef3.jpg" alt="Chef Set 2" width="500" height="333"></p>
<p title="Chef Hainanese Western Food">Their Mixed Grill Platters ($10) are very popular, which offers a serving of pork chop, tender chicken chops, fish cutlet and chicken sausage.</p>

<p title="Chef Hainanese Western Food">Along with the meats, there was a dollop of coleslaw, baked beans, baked potato and crinkle cut fries. It’s a lot for one person, so make sure you bring your appetite with you.</p>

<p title="Chef Hainanese Western Food">Old-school flavours, generous portion, the only thing holding me back is the long queue and longer wait.</p>

<p title="Chef Hainanese Western Food">Oh yes, it is only opened 2 hours a day, closed on Thurs.</p>

<h1 id="C2">Hong Kee Porridge</h1></p>


<body><p title="Hong Kee Porridge">Hong Kee Porridge is managed by a husband and wife, where he cooks, and she serves the bowls of piping hot porridge to your table. Just like every seasoned hawker, they were not the most amiable unless you are longtime customers. A little brusque and a touch cantankerous were all but endearing traits that makes the hawker culture a whole character on its own.</p>

<p title="Century egg porridge"><img src="cmwhongkee2.jpg" alt="Century egg porridge" width="500" height="333"></p>

<p title="Hong Kee Porridge">Hong Kee’s Pork Porridge With Century Egg (S$4) was served in a hefty bowl brimming with chunky quarters of century egg and slivers of pork.</p>

<p title="Fish porridge"><img src="cmwhongkee3.jpg" alt="Fish porridge" width="500" height="333"></p>
<p title="Hong Kee Porridge">The Sliced Fish Porridge that came with a spread of thinly sliced raw fish on the top that needs to be stirred in the porridge to cook. Thick and smooth, it was a texture you can only get at restaurants. Not to mention, a pleasant blandness that was so characteristic of porridge.</body></p>
